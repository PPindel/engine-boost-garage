Engine Boost Garage is a website of a garage specializing in tuning car engines and components. Dark theme with a contrasting orange color is a reference to late night rides in the light of street lamps - activity loved by every car lover, Need for Speed, Fast and Furios or JDM fan. Also provides clarity, readability and aesthetics.

#### Animations and Transitions

I didn't want to overwhelm the user with too much animation effects. In my opinion it's very easy to distract a user from main content by adding animations everywhere and finally it ends as bad user experience. See below the effects I used:

- The current page is marked by underline

- Hovering over the hiperlink element changes it color to yellow

- simply animation is added to social media icons

### Defect Tracking



## Accessibility

Accessibility testing is aimed to make sure that those with visual or physical disabilities can still browse your website. Some users have had strokes or accidents that make it difficult to use a mouse so they use keyboard keys to tab through sites. Others use screen readers that rely on HTML tags to help the user navigate quickly through the site to find information they want, others have color blindness or contrast issues. It's the law to provide services 
Here's a [site](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#:~:text=Accessibility%20is%20Important%20for%20Individuals%2C%20Businesses%2C%20Society,-The%20Web%20is&text=That%20is%2C%20the%20accessibility%20barriers,older%20people) where you can learn more about accessibility and the internet.
